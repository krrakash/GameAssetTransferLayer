üïπÔ∏è CrossChainTransfer Contract for Game Assets
Effortless Cross-Chain Transfers of In-Game Assets with LayerZero
‚öîÔ∏è Bridge game items, collectibles, and tokens across Ethereum, Polygon, and more!

Overview
The CrossChainTransfer contract is designed to seamlessly transfer in-game assets and collectibles across multiple blockchains. Leveraging LayerZero's ultra-light nodes, this contract supports game-based assets like weapons, armor, skins, collectibles, tokens, and multi-tokens (ERC-1155) across LayerZero-supported chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, and others.

üéÆ Key Features
In-Game Asset Compatibility: Supports ERC-1155 multi-token assets commonly used in games (e.g., items, power-ups, skins, and loot).
Cross-Chain Flexibility: Configured for LayerZero-compatible chains, enabling you to bridge assets across major blockchains.
NFT and Token Support: Also handles ERC-721 NFTs for unique items and ERC-20 for game-specific or ecosystem tokens.
Non-Standard Token Handling: Supports tokens like USDT and USDC, accommodating tokens with non-standard behaviors.
Security with LayerZero‚Äôs Trusted Remotes: Ensures that only verified cross-chain messages are processed.
‚öîÔ∏è Non-Standard Token Support
This contract is equipped to handle non-standard tokens (like USDT and USDC) which may deviate from the ERC-20 standard. It uses low-level calls to manage these tokens by:

Calling transfer and transferFrom using low-level call to ensure compatibility.
Verifying the call was successful and checking return data if present, to handle tokens that don‚Äôt return a value.
solidity
Copy code
function _safeERC20Transfer(
    address _token,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount
) internal {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = _token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, _to, _amount));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "ERC20 transfer failed");
}
üïπÔ∏è How It Works
Initiate Transfer: A player or game platform calls sendCrossChain, specifying:

Token Type (ERC-1155 for game items, ERC-721 for unique collectibles, ERC-20 for currency)
Amount or Token ID (e.g., weapon ID, quantity of resources)
Recipient Address (player‚Äôs address on the destination chain)
Destination Chain ID
Message Verification: LayerZero‚Äôs oracles and relayers verify and route the transaction securely to the destination chain.

Asset Receipt: The contract‚Äôs _nonblockingLzReceive function processes the message and delivers the item or asset to the player‚Äôs address on the destination chain.

üîß Setup & Deployment
Deploy on Each Chain: Deploy the contract on each network you wish to connect for asset bridging.
Set Trusted Remotes: Configure each contract‚Äôs address as a trusted remote on the corresponding chain for secure authorization.
Example constructor usage:

solidity
Copy code
// Deploy with LayerZero endpoint for your chain and the contract owner address
CrossChainTransfer contract = new CrossChainTransfer(_lzEndpoint, initialOwner);
Usage Example
To transfer an in-game asset (e.g., an ERC-1155 item) cross-chain:

solidity
Copy code
contract.sendCrossChain(
    _dstChainId,                // Destination Chain ID
    TokenType.ERC1155,          // Token type (e.g., ERC1155 for game items)
    ERC1155_TOKEN_ADDRESS,      // Address of the ERC-1155 token on the source chain
    itemId,                     // ID of the in-game item
    playerAddress,              // Player‚Äôs address on the destination chain
    bytes("additionalData")     // Extra data if required
);
üïπÔ∏è Supported Assets
ERC-1155: Game assets, multi-token items, resources, and in-game loot.
ERC-721: Unique collectibles, rare items, and exclusive character skins.
ERC-20: Game-specific tokens, in-game currency, and ecosystem assets.
